\begin{abstract}
As the subscriber base of telecommunication services reaches a saturation level, churning becomes a challenging problem with serious impact on revenues. We explore techniques like social media analytics and association rule mining to understand causes of churning in Indian context which may assist in churn reduction. 
\\
Enormous feeds are available on social media indicating a subscriber's satisfaction or dissatisfaction. These user's opinions include various parameters which point towards churning and can be effectively analysed for understanding causes of churning. In this paper our experiments are based on data taken from twitter. In the first phase, only telecom specific tweets are pulled from twitter, which are further cleaned for misspelled words. Stemming is then performed to tackle ambiguity. After transforming tweets into relational format we classify them using lexicon based classifier. Association rule mining is then applied to find the dominant churn factor out of a selected few factors as determined by domain expert.

\section{Introduction}
First mobile telephone service in India started in 1995. In recent years, mobile service usage has increased rapidly following the reduction in call cost and emerging use of new mobile phone technologies. Currently India's telecommunication network is the second largest in the world in terms of total number of telephone users (both fixed and mobile phone) [1] and it has one of the lowest call tariffs enabled by the mega telephone network operators and hyper-competition among them. On 30th September, 2013, country's telecom subscriber's base was as huge as 899.86 million [2] and penetration rate was about 71\%. Out of these 899.86 million subscribers, about 97 \% utilize wireless services.  We therefore focus our attention to wireless telecom services and mobile service providers as they are predominant in numbers. \\


Above situation depicts a condition where market is almost saturated and telecom service providers are stable. It leads to intensification of competition among existing mobile service providers in order to maintain their subscriber base. In such a situation, the significant business drivers would be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Retention of customer subscriberâ€™s base: As cost of acquisition of a new customer can substantially exceed the cost of retaining the existing customer [4].
\item Increase in average revenue per customer.
\end{itemize}

There is a trade off in these business drivers. Customer retention depends on factors like call rate and quality of services, a service provider provides. A superior quality of service imposes heavy implementation cost which has to be passed on to the customer. This has twin fall back of either higher call rate charges or subscriber churning. Hence, telecom service providers would want optimal values for both. In 1996, Reichheld [3] estimated that, with an increase in customer retention rate by 5\%, average net present value of a customer increases from 35\% to 95\% in different domains. 


In telecommunication, customer movement from one service provider to other service provider is defined by term churn rate. Churn rate is the percentage of subscribers who discontinue services with a service provider and change their service provider willingly. Customer churn rate is of great concern for any service provider. However according to statistical information provided by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) already 100+ million users have utilized mobile number portability service [2]. This is relatively very high, specially when the aim is to retain the existing customers. In order to better manage customer churn, companies need to fully understand the factors leading to the customer churn. These problems affecting churn have not been fully addressed in the literature. In this paper, we present a data mining based approach to determine factors affecting churn in Indian Telecom sector.
\subsection{Checking the PDF File}

Kindly assure that the Contact Volume Editor is given the name and email
address of the contact author for your paper. The Contact Volume Editor
uses these details to compile a list for our production department at
SPS in India. Once the files have been worked upon, SPS sends a copy of
the final pdf of each paper to its contact author. The contact author is
asked to check through the final pdf to make sure that no errors have
crept in during the transfer or preparation of the files. This should
not be seen as an opportunity to update or copyedit the papers, which is
not possible due to time constraints. Only errors introduced during the
preparation of the files will be corrected.

This round of checking takes place about two weeks after the files have
been sent to the Editorial by the Contact Volume Editor, i.e., roughly
seven weeks before the start of the conference for conference
proceedings, or seven weeks before the volume leaves the printer's, for
post-proceedings. If SPS does not receive a reply from a particular
contact author, within the timeframe given, then it is presumed that the
author has found no errors in the paper. The tight publication schedule
of LNCS does not allow SPS to send reminders or search for alternative
email addresses on the Internet.

In some cases, it is the Contact Volume Editor that checks all the final
pdfs. In such cases, the authors are not involved in the checking phase.

\subsection{Additional Information Required by the Volume Editor}

If you have more than one surname, please make sure that the Volume Editor
knows how you are to be listed in the author index.

\subsection{Copyright Forms}

The copyright form may be downloaded from the ``For Authors"
(Information for LNCS Authors) section of the LNCS Website:
\texttt{www.springer.com/lncs}. Please send your signed copyright form
to the Contact Volume Editor, either as a scanned pdf or by fax or by
courier. One author may sign on behalf of all of the other authors of a
particular paper. Digital signatures are acceptable.

\section{Paper Preparation}

Springer provides you with a complete integrated \LaTeX{} document class
(\texttt{llncs.cls}) for multi-author books such as those in the LNCS
series. Papers not complying with the LNCS style will be reformatted.
This can lead to an increase in the overall number of pages. We would
therefore urge you not to squash your paper.

Please always cancel any superfluous definitions that are
not actually used in your text. If you do not, these may conflict with
the definitions of the macro package, causing changes in the structure
of the text and leading to numerous mistakes in the proofs.

If you wonder what \LaTeX{} is and where it can be obtained, see the
``\textit{LaTeX project site}'' (\url{http://www.latex-project.org})
and especially the webpage ``\textit{How to get it}''
(\url{http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html}) respectively.

When you use \LaTeX\ together with our document class file,
\texttt{llncs.cls},
your text is typeset automatically in Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts.
Please do
\emph{not} change the preset fonts. If you have to use fonts other
than the preset fonts, kindly submit these with your files.

Please use the commands \verb+\label+ and \verb+\ref+ for
cross-references and the commands \verb+\bibitem+ and \verb+\cite+ for
references to the bibliography, to enable us to create hyperlinks at
these places.

For preparing your figures electronically and integrating them into
your source file we recommend using the standard \LaTeX{} \verb+graphics+ or
\verb+graphicx+ package. These provide the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.
In general, please refrain from using the \verb+\special+ command.

Remember to submit any further style files and
fonts you have used together with your source files.

\subsubsection{Headings.}

Headings should be capitalized
(i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other words
except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an
initial capital) and should,
with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left.
Words joined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first
word can stand alone, the second word should be capitalized.

Here are some examples of headings: ``Criteria to Disprove
Context-Freeness of Collage Language", ``On Correcting the Intrusion of
Tracing Non-deterministic Programs by Software", ``A User-Friendly and
Extendable Data Distribution System", ``Multi-flip Networks:
Parallelizing GenSAT", ``Self-determinations of Man".

\subsubsection{Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems.}

The numbers accorded to lemmas, propositions, and theorems, etc. should
appear in consecutive order, starting with Lemma 1, and not, for
example, with Lemma 11.

\subsection{Figures}

For \LaTeX\ users, we recommend using the \emph{graphics} or \emph{graphicx}
package and the \verb+\includegraphics+ command.

Please check that the lines in line drawings are not
interrupted and are of a constant width. Grids and details within the
figures must be clearly legible and may not be written one on top of
the other. Line drawings should have a resolution of at least 800 dpi
(preferably 1200 dpi). The lettering in figures should have a height of
2~mm (10-point type). Figures should be numbered and should have a
caption which should always be positioned \emph{under} the figures, in
contrast to the caption belonging to a table, which should always appear
\emph{above} the table; this is simply achieved as matter of sequence in
your source.

Please center the figures or your tabular material by using the \verb+\centering+
declaration. Short captions are centered by default between the margins
and typeset in 9-point type (Fig.~\ref{fig:example} shows an example).
The distance between text and figure is preset to be about 8~mm, the
distance between figure and caption about 6~mm.

To ensure that the reproduction of your illustrations is of a reasonable
quality, we advise against the use of shading. The contrast should be as
pronounced as possible.

If screenshots are necessary, please make sure that you are happy with
the print quality before you send the files.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.2cm]{eijkel2}
\caption{One kernel at $x_s$ (\emph{dotted kernel}) or two kernels at
$x_i$ and $x_j$ (\textit{left and right}) lead to the same summed estimate
at $x_s$. This shows a figure consisting of different types of
lines. Elements of the figure described in the caption should be set in
italics, in parentheses, as shown in this sample caption.}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Please define figures (and tables) as floating objects. Please avoid
using optional location parameters like ``\verb+[h]+" for ``here".

\paragraph{Remark 1.}

In the printed volumes, illustrations are generally black and white
(halftones), and only in exceptional cases, and if the author is
prepared to cover the extra cost for color reproduction, are colored
pictures accepted. Colored pictures are welcome in the electronic
version free of charge. If you send colored figures that are to be
printed in black and white, please make sure that they really are
legible in black and white. Some colors as well as the contrast of
converted colors show up very poorly when printed in black and white.

\subsection{Formulas}

Displayed equations or formulas are centered and set on a separate
line (with an extra line or halfline space above and below). Displayed
expressions should be numbered for reference. The numbers should be
consecutive within each section or within the contribution,
with numbers enclosed in parentheses and set on the right margin --
which is the default if you use the \emph{equation} environment, e.g.,
\begin{equation}
  \psi (u) = \int_{o}^{T} \left[\frac{1}{2}
  \left(\Lambda_{o}^{-1} u,u\right) + N^{\ast} (-u)\right] dt \;  .
\end{equation}

Equations should be punctuated in the same way as ordinary
text but with a small space before the end punctuation mark.

\subsection{Footnotes}

The superscript numeral used to refer to a footnote appears in the text
either directly after the word to be discussed or -- in relation to a
phrase or a sentence -- following the punctuation sign (comma,
semicolon, or period). Footnotes should appear at the bottom of
the
normal text area, with a line of about 2~cm set
immediately above them.\footnote{The footnote numeral is set flush left
and the text follows with the usual word spacing.}

\subsection{Program Code}

Program listings or program commands in the text are normally set in
typewriter font, e.g., CMTT10 or Courier.

     until Year = MaxYears
end.
